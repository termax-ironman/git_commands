Bitbucket is like GitHub but with a different vendor.

What functionality GitHub has, Bitbucket has similar functionality.

In industry, some organizations avoid using Microsoft products.
Because of this, many organizational dev teams have adopted Bitbucket instead of GitHub, gitlab.


Actually, Bitbucket is considered better in some enterprise use cases compared to GitHub and GitLab.

Key additional advantages of Bitbucket

Very strong Jira integration
Since Bitbucket and Jira are both Atlassian products:

Branch names auto-link with Jira tickets

Commits and PRs automatically update Jira status

PR screen directly shows Jira issue progress

Better branch visualization UI
When you create a branch, you get a clear graphical view of:

Which branch is created from which branch

Feature → release → hotfix flow

Bitbucket UI is minimalistic, clean, and easy to track, especially for large teams.

Enterprise-friendly access control
Bitbucket provides fine-grained permissions at:

Project level

Repository level
This is why banks and large enterprises prefer Bitbucket.

Simple CI/CD with Bitbucket Pipelines
Built-in pipelines are easy to configure for small and medium teams without heavy setup.

All these platforms — Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab — are built on the principles of Git.

They all:

Use the same Git client

Support the same Git commands

Follow the same Git workflow

So nothing actually changes in Git operations with respect to the platform.
Only the UI, ecosystem integration, vendor support, and enterprise tooling differ.
